# Code:
The network is trained with these two patterns, and any patters that the users gives will be associated to one of these patterns.

```python
p1=np.array([[1,-1]
             ,[-1,-1]
             ,[1,-1]])
```
You can run this code from your terminal/prompt/shell with typing

```python
python hop.py
```
